ive been broken down and torn apart just to be put back together again
how many times do i have to say i hate myself or im tired before i actually fo through with an other attempt
people are easily broken
on the other haad i was fragile
and yet
i was still tossed around
so really, hoe much can a person go through untill they've been completely destroyed
that answer to that is, its like a light switch
play with it too much and im sure you'll get a few flickers untill the fuse blows
but also
to go unnoticed is to be noticed but then suddenly you're not
to be unnoticed is to never be noticed at all
but whats the difference between feeling unnoticed and actually being unnoticed
well, theres so many answers to that twisted question
but what if your both?
what if you know your unnoticed but you feel it too
how can you ever feel noticed if you've spent your life being unnoticed
thats like
holding a bottle of milk to a thristy crying baby

most people you see with a smile on their face everyday are most likey the ones who sit in bed at 3 am everynight contemplating if this is their last breath
some people you pass by everyday most likely tired to attempt the night before but ended up waking up the nest day anyways
the thing is theres so many people with different back storys
everyone has a story to tell
some wish to never tell them storys some people have good storys to tell and others have sob storys to tell
either way everyone has a story
and within that story you'll be able to tell if they feel unoticed or if they are unoticed
so, to be unoticed is to never be noticed at all
hmm
we are all each different individuals
but we have the power to feel the same sort of things
we think differently and move in the same ways but at different paces
so if were all different then
why do i feel more different?
we all think differently
so does that mean that i feel at my lowest when someone elses lowest could be way lower?

am i really at rock bottom or am i trying to dig there?
am i really alone or am i the one pushing myself away?
question after question
over the course of time
ive slowly destroyed myself
so'
even if i did choose to live is life, im not living it for me.
im living it for the person i forgot i was
but  everyone has a different reasonings to stay and go
so i guess its true
we are all each different individuals
guys i wanna write more but my hands are cramping
